the responsiveness of the website on different screen sizes (Mobile S-320px, Mobile M-375px, Mobile L-425px, Tablet-768px, Laptop-1024px) using Devtools sevice toolbar. The different CSS propoerties for font, color, background-color, links, submit button work as expected.
animation of the hero-image text moves within the defined area.

Bugs
Fixed bugs
on different pages of the website, header background color was not visible on smaller devices.

to solve this bug, I used flex-direction:column instead of display:inline flex-direction
additionally, for code optimization, I removed repeated use of background color property from each media query.
Submission on contact page submits the information without validating the required entries.

to solve this bug, I removed the anchor tag as a descendent of the button and added page link in action attribute.
