 ## Bugs 

   - ### Fixed bugs
  
      - on different pages of the website, header background color was not visible on smaller devices.

      - to solve this bug, I used flex-direction:column instead of display:inline flex-direction
     
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122646108/216823781-ff0b9624-831a-4361-ba69-5ef1da4c9994.png)

       - additionally, for code optimization, I removed repeated use of background color property from each media query.
      
   - Submission on contact page submits the information without validating the required entries.

      - to solve this bug, I removed the anchor tag as a descendent of the button and added page link in action attribute.
